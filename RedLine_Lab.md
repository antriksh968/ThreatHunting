Scenario:

As a member of the Security Blue team, your assignment is to analyze a memory dump using Redline and Volatility tools. Your goal is to trace the steps taken by the attacker on the compromised machine and determine how they managed to bypass the Network Intrusion Detection System "NIDS". Your investigation will involve identifying the specific malware family employed in the attack, along with its characteristics. Additionally, your task is to identify and mitigate any traces or footprints left by the attacker.
 
Tools:
Volatility

In this scenario, we will use Tool volatility to analyze the memory dump
**Memory Dump: A memory dump is a process where a computer saves the contents of its random access memory (RAM) to a file. RAM is the volatile memory that a computer uses to store data that is actively being used or processed by the CPU. This storage is temporary, and when the computer is powered off or restarted, the contents of RAM are typically lost.

Here's a concise list of the types of data typically found in a memory dump:
Stack Traces: Information about the call stack for each active thread.
Memory Contents: The actual contents of RAM, including data structures and program code.
CPU Registers: The state of CPU registers at the time of the dump.
Process Information: Details about active processes and their memory space.
System Information: General information about the system and its configuration.
Kernel Memory: Information about the operating system kernel's memory.
Loaded Modules: List of loaded DLLs and other modules.
Memory Allocation Information: Details about memory allocation and usage.
Exception Information: Describes the exception or error that triggered the dump.
Timestamps: Time-related information indicating when the memory dump was created.
Q1- What is the name of the suspicious process?
