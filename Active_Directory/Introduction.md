**Active Directory (AD) **is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is a centralized database that stores information about resources on a network, such as users, computers, and applications. AD is used to manage and control access to network resources, such as files, printers, and other shared resources.AD is an important component of many enterprise networks and is widely used in organizations of all sizes. It integrates with other Microsoft technologies, such as Exchange and SharePoint, to provide a comprehensive solution for managing user authentication, authorization, and access to resources on the network. Additionally, it supports the use of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security and compliance policies, as well as provide an infrastructure for software distribution and patch management.
The main core of Active Directory is Kerberos. It is a protocol used for authentication, authorization process for large scale environments. We will cover basic terms in Active Directory as well as how Kerberos authentication works

**What is Kerberos?**

Kerberos is the default authentication service for Microsoft Windows domains. It is intended to be more "secure" than NTLM by using third party ticket authorization as well as stronger encryption. It runs on UDP port 88.
